                    <h3>Sate Ratu</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of the popular satay restaurants in Jogja is Sate Ratu. Quoting the official website of Sate Ratu, Sate Ratu did not start its journey as a satay restaurant directly. This restaurant originated from Angkringan Ratu, which was established in 2015. A year later, Angkringan Ratu was developed into the Sate Ratu restaurant. The name Sate Ratu comes from the word 'Ratu', which the owner considers to sound traditional and has a philosophy similar to Jogja, where its governance is in the form of a monarchy. Since its establishment, Sate Ratu has always been crowded with both local and international tourists. Visitors need not worry, as Sate Ratu also provides various beverages to quench their thirst, one of which is 'teh tubruk' (strong brewed tea). Various menus at Sate Ratu can be enjoyed by visitors with prices ranging from Rp6,000 to Rp30,000.
